# 🏠 Home Assistant Configuration

This repository contains the **public version** of my Home Assistant setup. It represents an ongoing effort to make my home smarter, more efficient, and easier to manage—while significantly reducing energy consumption.

> 📉 **Result:** As of today, this setup has helped reduce my **year-over-year energy usage by 38%**.

## 📦 What’s Included

This repository is structured to mirror a real-world Home Assistant configuration, with a focus on clarity and reusability.

### 🖥️ Dashboards

* Lovelace dashboard YAML
* Custom views for monitoring energy, presence, and key automations
* Designed for at-a-glance visibility and low-friction control

### ⚙️ Automations

* Event-driven automations for lighting, climate, presence, and energy optimization
* Time-, state-, and sensor-based triggers
* Emphasis on reliability and explainability

### 📜 Scripts

* Reusable logic blocks shared across automations
* Helper scripts for common household actions
* Designed to reduce duplication and simplify maintenance

### 📡 Sensors

* Template sensors
* Energy and power monitoring
* Derived and calculated sensors used for insights and automation decisions

### 🧩 Configuration

* Core Home Assistant configuration files
* Helpers, integrations, and entity organization
* Structured to be modular and easy to extend

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

* **Reduce energy consumption** without sacrificing comfort
* **Automate routine decisions** so the house reacts intelligently
* **Provide visibility** into energy usage, presence, and system state
* **Keep everything local-first** and privacy-conscious where possible

Energy efficiency is treated as a *system-wide concern*, not just a single dashboard or automation.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

* YAML-first, version-controlled configuration
* Prefer simple, composable automations over complex monoliths
* Clear naming and comments for long-term maintainability
* Optimized for Home Assistant OS

---

## 🚧 Notes & Disclaimers

* This is a **sanitized public version** of my personal Home Assistant configuration
* Secrets, entity IDs, and environment-specific details have been removed or generalized
* Some automations may require adjustment to fit different hardware or layouts
